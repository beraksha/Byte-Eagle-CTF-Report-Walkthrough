# Byte-Eagle-CTF-Report-Walkthrough
Beginner-friendly walkthrough of the Byte Eagle CTF, covering network scanning, SMB enumeration, Base64 decoding, and privilege escalation to capture flags using Kali Linux tools.

This report documents my hands-on experience with the Byte Eagle CTF, an ethical hacking challenge designed to teach vulnerability exploitation. Using various pre-installed offensive security tools (like `netdiscover`, `nmap`, `enum4linux`, and `smbclient`) I scanned networks, enumerated shares, decoded Base64 hints, and escalated privileges via SSH to capture two flags. Ideal for newcomers to cybersecurity—includes step-by-step commands, screenshots, and lessons on practical hacking ethics.

**Key Skills Covered:** Network scanning, SMB enumeration, privilege escalation, and basic decoding.
